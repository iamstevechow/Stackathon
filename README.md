Sous is a project developed over 5 days in order for the Fullstack Academy Stackathon. Sous is your own personal sous chef for your home kitchen that keeps track of food in your refrigerator and gives you recipe recommendations based on what will be expiring soonest.

There were three main goals for this project. The first goal of this project was to practice creating a progressive web application. The second goal of this project was to get more experience working with different types of user input. Sous features voice navigation as well as voice and image recognition through incorporating the Clarifai Image Recognition API and the WebSpeech API. The final goal of this project involved working with and rendering different sources of information, specifically information that I was unfamiliar with in terms of organizational structure. I accomplished this by working with the Edamame API to incorporate amazing recipe suggestions into my app.

Future goals include incorporating barcode scanning and diversifying recipe lookup.
